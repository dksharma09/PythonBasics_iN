1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
>>
Function helps to reuse a code anytime by just calling it.
Reduces lines of code. Uses less space.

Function call : To run a function, we need to call it.

>>
There's only one global Python scope per program execution.
There are 4 local scopes in python.
