1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
'hello'
-87.8
-
/
+
6

Ans >>

Expression are *, -, + and / while values are 'hello', -87.8 and 6.

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Ans >>

String is a type of variable and made up of group of characters while variable can store any kind of value like int, float, string etc. Variable is a named memory loaction.

3. Describe three different data types.

Ans >>

Int : It stores whole number.
Float : It stores decimal numbers.

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Ans >> 

Expression is made up of mathematial functions, values, variables and operators. It calulates the end result using variables, constants etc.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

Ans >>

While we use expressions, it concludes the expression to a single value while statement does not do this. 	

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

Ans >>

bacon will still contain 22. If we need to change it then expression will be like this below,
bacon = bacon + 1

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'

Ans >>

Result will be same in both the cases
'spamspamspam'

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Ans >>

Because variable name can not be started with a integer or operator.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

Ans >>

if x = '10'
so, 
for int value of x, y = int(x)
for floating value of x, y = float(x)
for string value of y, z = str(y)

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.'

Ans >>
This expression will cause an error because we can not add int to string.
To avoid this error write '99' like this. Now 99 will behave as string here.
