1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
>>
They are :
True and False.
while writting, we check the condition whether it is true or false.


2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
>>
They are :
AND -- Used when multiple conditions are true.
OR -- Used when only 1 condition is true among multiple or 2 conditions.
NOT -- Used when we need to exlude a condition.


3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
>>
AND :
x=1 and y=1 >>> 1
x=1 and y=0 >>> 0
x=0 and y=1 >>> 0
x=0 and y=0 >>> 0

OR :
x=1 or y=1 >>> 1
x=1 or y=0 >>> 1
x=0 or y=1 >>> 1
x=0 or y=0 >>> 0

NOT :
not(x=1) >>> 0
not(x=0) >>> 1


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
>>
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) >>> False
not (5 > 4) >>> False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) >>> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) >>> False
(True and True) and (True == False) >>> False
(not False) or (not True) >>> True


5. What are the six comparison operators?
>>>
They are :
> (Greater than)
< (Less than)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
<= (Less than or equal to)
== (equal to)
!= (Not equal to)


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
>>
Equal to operator is used to compare 2 different value while assignment operator is used to assign a value to any variable.
Like :
x = 5,
y = 5 are the examples of assigning values to variables while
x == y is an example of comparing 2 different variables.


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

>>>
This code has 3 different blocks :
a) if spam == 10 :
b) if spam > 5 :
c) else :


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
>>
spam = int(input("Enter the value of Spam, Please : "))
if (spam == 1) :
	print("Hello")
elif (spam == 2) :
	print("Howdy")
else :
   	print("Greetings!")


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
>>
Use "CTRL + C"


10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
>>
Break : It is used to get immediate exit from loop.
Continue : It is used to end the current iteration of the loop and go to the the next iteration of the loop.


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
>>
These 3 will give the same output here.
range function actually works like "range(start, end-1, steps)"
in range(10) : start = 0 and Steps = 1 are by default,
in range(0,10) : steps = 1 is by default.
while in range(0,10,1) : everything is provided.


12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
>>
Using for loop :
for i in range(1,11):
	print(i)

Using while loop :
i=1
while(i<=10):
	print(i)
	i = i+1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
>>
import spam
spam.bacon()
